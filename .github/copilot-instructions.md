keep the pip requirements and optional requirements up to date

write tests

test with static mqtt messages

test the scripts, make sure they run, only install requiremnts via the requirements files

add parameters to scripts rather than hardcode values like ports/hostnames etc. It's okay to default to sane defaults like localhost and the default port of services.
